# Simple Java Calculator

Originally this project was written using Eclipse, but I have migrated it to NetBeans.
This calculator is simple with an easy code to help novices learn how to operate a calculator.

If you use the executable file "calculator.jar" and that it does not run, you can type "java -jar /your_calculator_directory/calculator.jar" in your terminal.
